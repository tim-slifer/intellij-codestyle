# IntelliJ-Codestyle
This is my code style definition for IntelliJ IDEA.

## Installation
Copy the `codestyles` folder in this project into the `~/.IntelliJIdea/config/` folder and restart Idea.

## Code Styles
Code Styles are managed in Settings at Editor >> Code Style.  Click the "Manage" button and a default scheme can be set for all projects.  With a project open in Idea, click the "Manage" then "Copy to Project".  This will insert the XML file into the `.idea` directory of the project.
